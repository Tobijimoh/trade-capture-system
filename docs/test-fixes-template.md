# Test Fixes
___

## Test Class: TradeControllerTest

### Test Method: testCreateTrade

- **Problem:** The test expected HTTP 200 OK, but the controller correctly returned 201 Created for successful resource creation.
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect expectation in the test assertion.
- **Solution:** Updated the test to expect 201 Created instead of 200 OK.
- **Impact:** The test now properly verifies REST-compliant trade creation responses and passes successfully.
